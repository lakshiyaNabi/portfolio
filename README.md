This repository contains my personal portfolio website developed using HTML and CSS. The portfolio showcases my profile, skills, projects, achievements, and contact information in a clean and elegant layout. It is designed with a soft gradient background and modern UI elements to present my academic background and technical interests professionally. This project reflects my passion for web development and my ability to build responsive, visually appealing web pages suitable for internships and entry-level opportunities.
